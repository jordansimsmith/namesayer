# Viewing Past User Attempts

Each time a user records an attempt for a name or group of names, they are presented with an option to save that attempt.
The last attempt for each name combination will be saved, i.e. new saved attempts from the user will overwrite the existing saved attempt.
Historical user attempts can be accessed from the main menu by selecting the **View Existing Attempts** button.

The Existing attempts screen is fairly simple. In the middle of the screen, the list of available user attempts are displayed in alphabetical order
for the user's convenience. Each entry to this list contains the name or names that was practised and recorded, and the date that it was
recorded on. An example entry would be `James Jacinda - Wed Jan 03 21:07:21 NZDT 2018`. In this case, the names practiced were
James and Jacinda, in that order, and the date that it was practised on was Wednesday the 3rd of January.

Below the list of saved attempts is a simple volume slider. This volume slider allows the user to adjust the volume that the 
recordings are played back. The values on the slider range from 0 (muted) to 100 (maximum volume). The default value is 100. To use the 
volume slider, the user needs to simply adjust the volume before selecting a recording attempt to play.

Below the volume slider is the play button. The play button is used to hear the past user recording for the attempt selected
in the list. To use the play button, the user should first select the recording that they would like to hear, and then press
the play button. If no recording is selected, then a warning dialogue will pop up, guiding the user into selecting a recording 
before playing.

Finally, the close button at the base of the screen is used to close this screen and return to the main menu.
