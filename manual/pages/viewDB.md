# Access Database
Please ensure NameSayer is properly [set up](https://github.com/jordansimsmith/namesayer-part03/blob/master/Manual/SetUp.md) before commencing.

This fucntion allows users to view the entire database and is provided for more experienced users.

The ListView on the left allows users to quick browse through all available names from the database. The list is in alphabetical order which increases usability. The ListView on the right hand side of the application gives users an indication of how many names as well as what names are selected. More advanced users may wish to randomise the order in which they practise the names. This can achieved via selecting the shuffle checkbox. The centre of this scene houses the label for displaying the courrent construction of a name. This feature aids the user in correctly selecting the name they would like to practise without having to glance back at previous selections or guess.

## Basic Instructions

1. Manually construct full names by selecting the checkboxes next to each part of the name in order
2. The name will show up in the centre of the application, indicating the current name
3. Users can add more names to the current name by repeating step 1 or remove particular parts by deselecting the checkboxes
4. Select *Add Name* to transfer the select names to the list under *Names to Practise*
5. Users can add more full names to the list by repeating steps 1-4
*Optional:* Users can shuffle the playlist by selecting the *Shuffle* checkbox
6. Select the *Playback* button when ready. This will take the user to the [practise scene](https://github.com/jordansimsmith/namesayer-part03/blob/master/manual/practice.md)
7. Users may choose to return to the main menu at any time via the *Return* button
