# Special Features
To enhance the user's experience with NameSayer, several special features have been added. These features have been designed
with both the target user and all other users in mind.

## Streaks
A NameSayer streak occurs when the user has been using the program for at least 2 days consecutively. Every consecutive day 
that a user uses NameSayer, the streak will be incremented. If a user does not log onto NameSayer for a whole day, the 
streak will be reset. Streaks are an effective form of motivation for the user to keep returning to the application, 
improving their name pronunciation.

Upon opening the NameSayer application, if a streak is present, the user will be congratulated on their consistent efforts.
A pop up window will appear, with an affirmation as well as the length of the streak (number of days).

## Selective Rating
NameSayer offers the option to either practice a name individually or amongst a group of other names, for example,
practising a persons's first and last name together. Upon listening to a name in the database of low quality, the user may
choose to flag this name to the database maintainer using the **Bad Recording** button. 

When practising more than one name
at once, the user may require that one or more of the played names be flagged as low quality. The **Bad Recording** button
prompts the user to select the name that they would like to flag, instead of flagging the whole selection or none of it.

## Multiple File Upload
One of the features of NameSayer is that a user can upload a text file containing a list of names to be practised together or 
sequentially. NameSayer extends this functionality such that multiple lists can be combined together, instead of restricting
the user to a single file upload.

## Live Search Validation
Another feature of NameSayer is an explicit search for a name or group of names. To enhance usability, NameSayer filters 
the user's search query in real time for invalid characters. Thus, the user's search will not be invalidated because of disallowed
characters. A live filter is also much more intuitive for the user. Instead of typing out an entire query to be told that it is invalid,
a live filter lets a user know right away what can be searched for and what can't be.
