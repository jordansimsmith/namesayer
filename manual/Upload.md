# Upload option
Please make sure NameSayer is properly [set up](https://github.com/jordansimsmith/namesayer-part03/blob/master/Manual/SetUp.md) before commencing.

## File format
NameSayer is calibrated to read names from text files in the following format:
```
FirstName- ... -FirstName MiddleName- ... -MiddleName LastName- ... -LastName
```
Each full name should be in a seperate line entry. Each name should be seperated by either a space "‚ê£", or a hyphen "-".

## Basic Features
1.Select the *Upload* button on the ```Upload``` screen. NameSayer will prompt the user to select a text file. Please note, the file browser is set to show .txt files only.
2. After selecting the desired file, NameSayer will go through every single entry in the file and display the names available in the database and list those unavailable in red.
3. Users can choose to upload more text files via the *Upload* button. 
4. Select the *Practise* button to start practising. This will take the user to the [practise scene](https://github.com/jordansimsmith/namesayer-part03/blob/master/Manual/Practice.md)

## Advanced Features
- **Filtered File Browser** - Only text files are allowed to be selected. This avoids incorrect file input from the user.

- **Mutiple File Upload** - NameSayer allows users to upload more than one text file. This allows users to practise more names and encourages users to store names in via a systematic method.
