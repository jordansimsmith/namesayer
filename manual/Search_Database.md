# Search Database
Please ensure NameSayer is properly [set up](https://github.com/jordansimsmith/namesayer-part03/blob/master/Manual/SetUp.md) before commencing.

## Basic Instructions

1. Search for the desired name using the textfield
2. Select the *Search* button when the user is content with the input
3. The application will return a string of name/s found in the database and another string in red representing name/s unavailable 
4. The user can select the *Practise* once sattisfied with the results. This will take the user to the [practise scene](https://github.com/jordansimsmith/namesayer-part03/blob/master/manual/practice.md)
5. Users may choose to return to the main menu at any time via the *Return* button

## Advanced Features
- **Live Input Validation** - The textfield automatically rejects illegal characters. Illegal characters are all characters other than the alphabet, the hyphen, and the apostrophe. This reduces user confusion and increases the robustness of the application.
